# Software Development Exercises - UE04  

## üìú Tasks  
This exercise focuses on working with one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays in Java. The tasks include:  

### 1. Expanding Arrays  
Dynamically increase the size of a one-dimensional array as new integers are entered from the console.  
- **Program:** `ReadArray.java`  

---

### 2. Population Growth  
Analyze population growth in Javaland by calculating year-over-year differences and identifying the maximum difference.  
- **Program:** `JavalandPopulation.java`  

---

### 3. Minimum 2x2 Squares  
Read a two-dimensional array from a file and identify the 2x2 sub-matrix with the smallest sum.  
- **Program:** `MinSquare.java`  

---

### 4. House Construction in Javaland  
Validate construction rules for upper floor layouts in Javaland by comparing two 2D arrays (ground floor and first floor).  
- **Program:** `HouseChecker.java`
